## My process

### Built with

- Angular Framework v19, https://angular.dev/
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS

### What I learned

I used this project to deal with signals in Angular for the first time, as well as new features from v.19, e.g. the resource API. I wanted to avoid the implementation with observables. I used CSS instead of SCSS, as CSS has made great strides forward in recent years.

### Continued development

I would like to focus more on accessibility in the future. So far, I haven't gained much experience in this area. But I would also like to expand the concept with Signals at the same time as developing Angular.

### Useful resources

- [json-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server) - It helped me to simulate the data as an HTTP request.
